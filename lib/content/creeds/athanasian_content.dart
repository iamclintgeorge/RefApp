        "Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. \nWhich faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.\n\n"
        "And the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; \nneither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. \nFor there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. \nBut the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal.\n\n"
        "Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. \nThe Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated. \nThe Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited. \nThe Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. \nAnd yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal.\n\n"
        "As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. \nSo likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. \nAnd yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty.\n\n"
        "So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. \nAnd yet they are not three Gods; but one God. \nSo likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. \nAnd yet not three Lords; but one Lord.\n\n"
        "For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; \nSo are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords.\n\n"
        "The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. \nThe Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. \nThe Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding.\n\n"
        "So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. \nAnd in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. \nBut the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal.\n\n"
        "So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. \nHe therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.\n\n"
        "Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. \nFor the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; \nGod, of the Essence of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Essence of his Mother, born in the world.\n\n"
        "Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. \nEqual to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. \nWho although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. \nOne; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood by God.\n\n"
        "One altogether; not by confusion of Essence; but by unity of Person. \nFor as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; \nWho suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead.\n\n"
        "He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the God the Father Almighty, \nfrom whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. \nAt whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; \nAnd shall give account for their own works.\n\n"
        "And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.\n\n"
        "This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.",
